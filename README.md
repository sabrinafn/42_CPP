**C++ Projects**

In the C++ projects up to CPP02, I’ve focused on mastering the fundamentals of C++ programming, including object-oriented concepts and proper memory management.

**Key Areas Covered**:


CPP00: This project introduced me to the basic structure of C++ programs, data types, and I/O operations.

CPP01: I dove into object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading.

CPP02: This project was more focused on deeper aspects of OOP, including dynamic memory allocation, advanced class inheritance, and polymorphism.

These projects solidified my understanding of C++ and enhanced my ability to write efficient, maintainable code while adhering to best practices in object-oriented design. They helped me gain hands-on experience with the core features of C++ that will be essential for more advanced topics. I’m still learning C++, and these projects are just the beginning of my journey into the language.
