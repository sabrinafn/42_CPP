*** School 42 - C++ projects ***

Through the C++ projects from CPP00 to CPP09 at School 42, I have developed a strong understanding of modern C++ programming. Each module progressively deepened my knowledge in topics ranging from basic syntax to advanced concepts like templates, STL, and exception handling.

*** Key Areas Covered: ***
CPP00: Introduction to the basic structure of C++ programs, data types, I/O operations, and basic class handling.

CPP01: Focus on object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes, constructors, destructors, and operator overloading.

CPP02: Deeper exploration of OOP with dynamic memory allocation, class inheritance, and polymorphism.

CPP03: Emphasis on understanding orthodox canonical form, copy constructors, assignment operators, and proper resource management.

CPP04: Introduction to abstract classes, interfaces, and deeper usage of polymorphism with pure virtual functions.

CPP05: Mastery of C++ exception handling, learning how to design robust and fault-tolerant applications.

CPP06: Introduction to C++ file I/O operations, focusing on parsing, reading, and writing files efficiently.

CPP07: Practical usage of standard containers like vector, list, and deque, as well as iterators and generic algorithms.

CPP08: Focus on templates and generic programming, creating type-agnostic classes and functions while understanding code reuse at scale.

CPP09: Advanced usage of the Standard Template Library (STL), algorithms, containers, and implementing real-world problem-solving with clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

  These projects significantly strengthened my skills in object-oriented design, memory management, and problem-solving using C++. Completing all modules has given me a solid foundation not only in language features but also in writing efficient, safe, and scalable C++ code.
