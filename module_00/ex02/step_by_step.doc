A step-by-step breakdown of the process to reconstruct Account.cpp:

Phase 1: Understanding the Header and Log

1. Read Account.hpp:
    Identify all member variables (both static and instance).
    List all member functions (constructors, destructors, static functions, instance functions).
    Note the return types and parameter types of each function.
2. Analyze the Log File:
    Observe the timestamp format at the beginning of each line.
    Identify the sequence of operations (constructor calls, deposits, withdrawals, status displays, destructor calls).
    Determine the input values passed to functions and the resulting output.
    Deduce the logic of each function based on the input-output relationships.
    Note the initial values of static variables and how they change.
    Pay close attention to the messages related to successful and failed withdrawals.

Phase 2: Implementing Account.cpp
3. Create Account.cpp:
    Create a new file named Account.cpp.
    Include Account.hpp and necessary standard library headers (e.g., iostream, iomanip, ctime).
4. Initialize Static Variables:
    Outside the class definition, initialize all static member variables to their appropriate starting values (likely 0).
5. Implement _displayTimestamp():
    Write the function to produce the timestamp in the exact format shown in the log file (using time functions and output formatting).
6. Implement the Constructor:
    Write the constructor that takes an initial_deposit as input.
    Assign the _accountIndex based on the number of accounts created.
    Set the _amount to the initial_deposit.
    Update static variables related to the number of accounts and total amount.
    Output the account creation message in the log's format, including the timestamp.
7. Implement the Destructor:
    Write the destructor to output the account closure message in the log's format, including the timestamp.
8. Implement displayAccountsInfos():
    Write the function to output the values of the static member variables in the log's format, including the timestamp.
9. Implement displayStatus():
    Write the function to output the current state of an account in the log's format, including the timestamp.
10. Implement makeDeposit():
    Write the function to add a deposit to the account.
    Update the account's _amount and _nbDeposits.
    Update the static variables related to total amount and total deposits.
    Output the deposit message in the log's format, including the timestamp.
11. Implement makeWithdrawal():
    Write the function to handle withdrawals.
    Check if the withdrawal is possible (sufficient funds).
    If possible, update the account's _amount and _nbWithdrawals, and update the static variables.
    Output the withdrawal message (success or refusal) in the log's format, including the timestamp.
12. Implement checkAmount():
    Write the function to return the account's current balance.

Phase 3: Compilation and Testing
13. Create Makefile:
    Create a Makefile to compile Account.cpp and tests.cpp.
14. Compile the Program:
    Use make to compile the program.
15. Run the Executable:
    Execute the compiled program.
16. Compare Output:
    Compare the program's output with the log file, ensuring they match exactly (except for timestamps).
    The 'diff' command can be used to compare both files.
17. Iterate and Debug:
    If the output doesn't match, review Account.cpp, correct errors, and repeat steps 14-16.
18. Verify with tests.cpp:
    Ensure that all tests within the test.cpp file pass.
